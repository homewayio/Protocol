## Homeway Protocol

This repo holds the Homeway plugin to service protocol based on flatbuffers. This protocol is the main communication pipeline for all http streams and websockets... it's where the magic happens.

## Support

We are happy to invite other developers to play with or build off this protocol. However, we don't guarantee future comparability with services, so use at your own risk. :)

## Why Did We Fork Flatbuffer?

This project is based on our sister's project's forked version of flatbuffers. You can find the details here:
